<b style="color: yellow">Description</b>

This mod was inspired by the original idea of the Super (Alternate) Recipes mod for the base game. I adapted the functions of that mod for the Satisfactory Plus mod.

The SARSF+ mod adds more efficient recipes for almost every item in the Satisfactory Plus mod. Basically, the mod includes versions where you use 1 ingredient to generate 10 products at the base speed of 10 seconds.

- Over 200 recipes added.
- 12 recipes adapted to be crafted in the Workbench.
- New recipes in the Tutorial, Milestones, and MAM.

<b style="color: yellow">Important Information</b>

- The added recipes in the MAM may appear as duplicates, but one item is with the default recipe, and the other is with the SARSF+ recipe.
- SARSF+ recipes start with the name "Super" on workbenches and buildings once unlocked.
- All recipes are grouped by base ingredient to facilitate searching for recipes within each building.
- Alternative recipes for milestones are separated into a new milestone per tier. You need to unlock this milestone to access the alternative recipes.
- Alternative recipes are for items and equipment. Constructions, parts, and any items that need to be built still use the default recipe.
- Due to a bug in ContentLib (a mod used for many of the alternative recipes), the recipes for the Workbench and Workshop Equipment may mix. Therefore, you can make recipes from both on both workbenches.
- If you have identical recipes on the Workbench or Workshop Equipment, check the ingredients. Each recipe uses a different ingredient. For example, if you see three Tin Ingot recipes, each one is made with a different ingredient.
- ContentLib is listed as one of the mods that may be incompatible with Satisfactory Plus, but I tested all the recipes in my game, and they worked normally. The recipes were created in ContentLib, and the Schemas and Categories in the Unreal Editor.
- There are currently no SARSF+ alternative recipes for the A.I. Fluid Packager. I couldn't find the original recipes in the mod files. I plan to create versions of these recipes soon and include them in SARSF+.

I am gradually developing the remaining recipes. There are recipes that are very complex to find the IDs and determine the category. I will update them as I manage to finish the recipes.
